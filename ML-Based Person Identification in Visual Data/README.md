# Project#2: 
# Image Processing using Machine Learning

This project is in Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn. It is a Supervised Machine Learning-based problem. The main goal of this problem was a prediction based on given 20/20 different images of both Male and Female actors. This data was trained on different Machine Learning algorithms such as Random Forest, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression. The SVM algorithm had the highest accuracy 75% among the listed algorithms.


## Steps Performed:
- Importing libraries
- Creating the Dataset
- Reading and Understanding the Dataset
- Preprocessing the Dataset
- Preparing the data for model building
- Defining the model
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Predicting the test dataset
- Evaluating the model
