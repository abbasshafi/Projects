# Uber Rides Prediction

In this project, I built a machine-learning model to predict the number of Uber rides in a given city at a given time. I have used linear regression to train the model and evaluated its performance on a portion of the data. I also conducted some analysis of the results, including visualizations and an exploration of the factors that contribute most to the number of rides. This project demonstrates my ability to apply machine learning techniques to predict demand for a service and to analyze and interpret the results.


## Steps Performed
- Importing libraries
- Reading and Understanding the Dataset
- Preprocessing the Dataset
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Preparing the data for model building
- Defining the model
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Predicting the test dataset
- Evaluating the model
- Deployment on Heroku
