# Project#1: 
# Uber Rides Prediction

This project is in Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn. It is Supervised Machine Learning algorithm Linear Regression based problem. Main goal of this algorithm was to predict number of rides available given different features. I have achived 86% accuracy. This model is saved using pickle and deployed using Heroku.


## Steps Performed
- Importing libraries
- Reading and Understanding the Dataset
- Preprocessing the Dataset
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Preparing the data for model building
- Defining the model
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Predicting the test dataset
- Evaluating the model
