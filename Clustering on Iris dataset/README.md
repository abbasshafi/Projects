# Clustering Technique on Iris Flower

This project is in Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn. It is an Unsupervised Machine Learning-based problem. The main goal of this problem was to predict Different Clusters based on the given Iris Flower dataset. This data was trained on the K-Means algorithm.

## Concise Steps:
- Importing the main libraries.
- Reading and Understanding the Dataset.
- Preprocessing the Dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Preparing the data for model building.
- Using the Elbow Method For the Optimal Number of Clusters.
- Defining the model.
- Predicting the test dataset.
- Visualizing Predicted Clusters with their Centroids.
