#Project: Enhanced Restaurant Recommendation System with Collaborative Filtering and Textual Data Analysis
This project delves into restaurant recommendations, combining collaborative filtering with textual data analysis using NLTK to provide more comprehensive suggestions.

#Objective:
Develop a system that recommends restaurants to users, considering both their past dining preferences and reviews using Collborative Filtering.

#Methodology:
1. Data Acquisition:
2. Data Preprocessing:

3. Pre-processing using NLTK:
       Tokenization
       Stop word removal
       Stemming or Lemmatization
       Text cleaning
4. Model Building:
5. Recommendation Generation:

#Steps:
